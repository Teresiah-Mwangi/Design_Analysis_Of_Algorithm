Huffman Coding

Huffman coding is a lossless compression algorithm assigning variable-length codes to characters based on frequency. 
It uses a binary tree for efficient encoding and decoding.

Merge Two Sorted Arrays

This program merges two user-input sorted arrays into a single sorted array. Users provide the array sizes and elements. The algorithm ensures efficient merging with a time complexity of 
O(n).
